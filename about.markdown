This website is being managed by **IBM Research**. IBM Research have invested a significant amount of resources in the Neuro-Symbolic AI research. We were not able to find a comprehensive source for the information in this area. This motivated us to start this page. Our goal is to join forces with the community to make it easy for locating and comparing the existing work. We hope this effort will also enable us to connect with various teams for information sharing and cross pollination of ideas.


# Neuro-Symbolic AI

The current reigning paradigm of AI is deep learning (DL), including deep RL when complete systems which take action in the world are considered.  It has shown many successes since 2006 or so, and dominated AI research for at least a decade.  However, scrutiny over time has also revealed several key shortcomings, particularly from the standpoint of the original goals of AI.   At least three of these include:  1) the lack of understandability of the models, which is particularly crucial in critical applications such as health or the most pivotal application of a business (e.g. loan approval for a bank), 2) the need for very large training sets, i.e. labeled examples, which is particularly at odds with many of the most important enterprise applications (e.g. fraud detection), and 3) the overall inability to solve complex problems, particularly those requiring incorporation of extensive domain knowledge and the ability to piece together multiple pieces of knowledge (aka reasoning), as highlighted, e.g. by the poor performance of state-of-the-art NLP-based systems such as Siri or Alexa.  [LINK: WIRED ARTICLE ABOUT READING NY TIMES, FROM MY THEME SLIDES] A more complete modern list of desiderata can be extracted from a 2019 twitter exchange [LINK: FROM MY THEME OVERVIEWS SLIDES}  between Yoshua Bengio and Gary Marcus, together representing what many AI researchers across the spectrum would likely agree are needed in a "true AI" or artificial general intelligence (AGI) approach.  The neuro-symbolic AI  theme aims to conceive a fundamental new methodology for AI, which has a core hypothesis that treatment of these issues can be achieved via a melding of the ideas of knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) and those of modern statistical machine learning (ML).
